Manual Review

Manual reviews are essential for ensuring the quality, security, and usability of the project beyond what automated tests can cover. The manual review process in this project focuses on:



🔍 Review Areas:

Code Quality: Ensures clean, readable, and maintainable code.



UI/UX Review: Verifies that the user interface is intuitive and user-friendly.



Security: Checks for common vulnerabilities such as exposed endpoints, poor authentication, or injection flaws.



Functionality Testing: Manually tests core features like user registration, booking, and payment flow to ensure expected behavior.



Responsiveness: Confirms that the application works well on different devices and screen sizes.



📋 Review Checklist:

&nbsp;Code follows PEP8 (Python) and general backend best practices.



&nbsp;Forms and user flows function correctly.



&nbsp;User roles and access permissions work as expected.



&nbsp;Payment gateway integration reviewed and tested.



&nbsp;API endpoints tested with tools like Postman or curl.



👥 Review Team:

Lead Developer – Reviewed code and architecture



UI/UX Designer – Validated interface and responsiveness



QA Tester – Performed feature and regression testing



This manual review will be repeated at key milestones before each major deployment.
