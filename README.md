\## Technology Stack



\### 1. Django

A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend logic of the application, including handling user requests, authentication, and serving data via RESTful APIs.



\### 2. PostgreSQL

An open-source relational database system used to store user data, property listings, bookings, and other structured data securely.



\### 3. HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Used to build the frontend of the web application. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity.



\### 4. Bootstrap

A frontend CSS framework that helps create responsive, mobile-friendly layouts quickly.



\### 5. Git \& GitHub

Version control system (Git) and hosting platform (GitHub) used for tracking changes in code and collaborating with the development team.



\### 6. Docker (if used)

Used to containerize the application, making it easier to deploy across different environments consistently.



\### 7. GraphQL (if used)

An API query language that allows the client to request only the data it needs, improving performance and flexibility compared to traditional REST APIs.

\### 3. Bookings

\- `id`: Unique identifier

\- `user\_id`: Guest making the booking

\- `property\_id`: The property being booked

\- `check\_in\_date`: Start date

\- `check\_out\_date`: End date



🔁 \*\*Relationships\*\*:  

\- A booking is linked to one user (guest)  

\- A booking is linked to one property  



---



\### 4. Reviews

\- `id`: Unique identifier

\- `user\_id`: Reviewer (guest)

\- `property\_id`: Property being reviewed

\- `rating`: Numeric score

\- `comment`: Review message



🔁 \*\*Relationships\*\*:  

\- A review is written by a user for a property  

\- A property can have multiple reviews  



---



\### 5. Payments

\- `id`: Unique identifier

\- A payment is tied to a specific booking  

\- A payment is made by a user  



Feature Breakdown

🧑‍💼 User Management

Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely. This feature enables authentication and authorization, ensuring that users can access their own data and perform actions based on their role (guest or host).



🏠 Property Management

Hosts can list properties by uploading details such as photos, descriptions, pricing, and availability. This feature is essential for adding accommodations and managing listings on the platform.



📅 Booking System

Users can search for available properties and make reservations based on date and availability. This system handles booking logic, availability checks, and confirmation workflows.



💳 Payment Integration

Enables secure payment processing for bookings. This feature ensures that users can pay for stays using payment gateways, and hosts can receive payouts.



⭐ Review and Rating System

After completing a stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings. This helps maintain trust in the community and gives other users insight into the quality of listings and hosts.



🔍 Search and Filter

Allows users to search for properties using filters like location, price range, date, number of guests, and amenities. This makes it easier to find relevant listings based on preferences.



📊 Admin Dashboard

Provides administrative users with tools to monitor platform activity, manage users, and remove inappropriate listings or reviews. This ensures the overall health and safety of the application







API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect sensitive user data and ensure the overall integrity of the Airbnb Clone platform. Below are the key security measures implemented:



1\. Authentication

Only registered users can access certain endpoints using secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Authentication ensures that users are who they claim to be, preventing unauthorized access to protected resources.



2\. Authorization

Once authenticated, users are granted permissions based on their roles (e.g., guest, host, admin). This ensures that a user can only perform actions that they’re allowed to—such as a guest booking a property but not deleting someone else’s listing.



3\. Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, the API will limit the number of requests from a single IP address over a period of time. This helps protect the server from being overwhelmed by excessive traffic.



4\. Data Validation \& Sanitization

All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). This protects the database and frontend from malicious input.



5\. HTTPS \& Secure Headers

The API communicates over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. Additionally, secure HTTP headers (like Content-Security-Policy and X-Content-Type-Options) are used to enhance browser-level security.



6\. Sensitive Data Protection

Sensitive information such as passwords and payment details are hashed or tokenized and never stored in plain text. This helps reduce the impact in case of a data breach.



Why API Security Is Crucial:

🔒 Protecting User Data – Ensures personal and financial data remains private and secure.



🏦 Securing Payments – Prevents fraud and unauthorized transactions.



🚫 Preventing Abuse – Keeps the platform safe from bots, spam, and brute-force attacks.



✅ Maintaining Trust – Security builds confidence among users and hosts.
